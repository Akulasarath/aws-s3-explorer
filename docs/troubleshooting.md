# Troubleshooting
Something went wrong, no matter, here are some suggested solution to common issues:

### I'm not sure what the problem is, but it isn't work
Usually there is some popup error that will say what the problem is. In the case there isn't, open the browser inspector `F-12` on the keyboard, and view the console. There will definitely be an error in there. If you aren't sure what's an error and was isn't, feel free to take a screenshot of console messages and [create a new issue](https://github.com/Rhosys/aws-s3-explorer/issues) with the screenshots attached.

### Cognito Invalid State
After completing the configuration, and entering the AWS account to log in. Your SSO provider redirects you to the Cognito screen that looks like this:

"An error was encountered with th requested page: Invalid state"

![Cognito Invalid State][./cognito-invalid-state]

**Solution**
The callback url is incorrect, the callback url must be `https://console.rhosys.ch` (or in the case you are hosting your own version, the url to that version).

### This site can't be reached
Login works, but then you are redirected to an error page that says `This site can't be reached`.

**Solution**
You must be using `https://console.rhosys.ch` to log in OR deploy the the site to your own infrastructure.

### How to grant Read Only access to the buckets in the account?
Bucket access is controlled through the role generated by the CloudFormation template, you can go to the account and update the role `S3_Explorer_Authenticated_User-Region` to only have the access to S3 that you want to give. So instead of: `"Action": "*"` use: `"Action": ["s3:GetObject"]`. Caveat: changing resources managed by the stack may be reverted on upgrading the running version of the S3-Explorer. Before upgrading always verify the changes.
